I called my mom I called my friend
Looking for a reason to go home again
But you make me feel like I don't belong
Like my heart's too weak and my head's too strong
Opposites attract sometimes but not the way
You're attracting mine
And I can't cange the way you are
Even though you think you're some kind of rock star

I want you out of my life
'Cause your heart is as cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door
I don't want to see you no more

You want me to walk like this and talk like that
Dye my hair and don't wear hats
And dress too sleazy and go too far
But all I want to do is play my guitar
And I don't think that it's fair
And I don't think that you care about me
Yeah but I see the way it's got to be
I want you out of my life

Why am I in this alone
Is my love too much for you
What's wrong with home
I hope you have found your answer
Becuase I think that I found mine
I want you out of my life
